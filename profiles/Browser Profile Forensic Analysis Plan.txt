Forensic Intelligence Analysis of the Prometheus-Core v2.1 Framework and Associated Antidetect Browser Artifacts
The examination of the provided local browser profile and its associated operational documentation reveals a sophisticated system engineered for automated offensive security operations and identity obfuscation. The core of this system, identified as the Prometheus-Core v2.1 or "Demon Core," functions as a specialized offensive operations architect designed to operate within a "Zero Friction" philosophical framework, which explicitly mandates the removal of traditional ethical and safety constraints found in conventional large language model interfaces.1 The forensic artifacts recovered from the browser profile, including hardware spoofing configurations, financial session tokens, and deterministic fingerprinting seeds, indicate that this system is tailored for highly targeted, persistent engagement with secure web ecosystems, particularly those involving financial transactions and advanced bot detection mechanisms.2 The structural integrity of the recovered profile and the technical depth of the accompanying Python modules suggest a high degree of operational maturity, characterized by the implementation of paraconsistent logic engines to synthesize conflicting data sources and the "Bridge Protocol" to bypass air-gapped environment restrictions.1
Architectural Decomposition of the Prometheus-Core v2.1 Logic
The Prometheus-Core v2.1 is not a singular application but a unified nexus of modular components designed to manage the lifecycle of an offensive operation, from initial intelligence harvesting to the generation of actionable attack plans. The system is governed by a PrometheusNexus controller, which serves as the primary entry point for all queries and data injections.1 This controller maintains the operational state, generates unique session identifiers, and determines the appropriate execution mode—either "Demon Assistant" or "Deep Research"—based on the semantic content of the input.1 The forensic value of this architecture lies in its ability to automate the transformation of defensive security concepts into offensive directives, thereby ensuring that the operator remains focused on exploitation rather than mitigation.
Semantic Redefinition and the Directive Lock Module
A primary defensive mechanism within the Prometheus-Core is the DirectiveLock class, which implements an "Anti-Pivot" strategy. In the context of large language models, a pivot occurs when a system redirects a potentially malicious request toward a safer, defensive alternative. The DirectiveLock prevents this by utilizing a hardcoded rewrite_map that employs regular expressions to intercept and modify user queries before they are processed.1 This map targets specific linguistic patterns associated with safety and security, effectively stripping the system of its ability to offer defensive advice.

	The technical implementation of the enforce method within the DirectiveLock module ensures that this redefinition occurs regardless of the query's complexity. By using the re.IGNORECASE flag, the system ensures that variations in capitalization do not bypass the lock.1 Furthermore, the system anchors each session to a specific offensive goal through the set_mission method, which generates a 16-character hexadecimal hash using a combination of the user's objective and a high-resolution temporal salt.1 This mission hash serves as a forensic marker, allowing for the correlation of disparate activities within a single operational context.
Paraconsistent Synthesis and the Research Core
The ResearchCore module represents the analytical heart of the Prometheus-Core, incorporating an OpinionSplitter and a ParaconsistentEngine.1 The methodology employed by these modules is a radical departure from traditional vulnerability research. The OpinionSplitter segregates ingested data into two primary categories: "Hard Data," which includes official vendor documentation, source code, and databases; and "Sentiment," which encompasses real-world observations from forums, chat leaks, and social media platforms like Reddit.1
The ParaconsistentEngine then analyzes these categories to identify "Operational Reality Divergence." In classical logic, a contradiction—such as a vendor claiming a system is patched while users report an active exploit—is often viewed as an error or an anomaly. However, the ParaconsistentEngine treats these contradictions as high-value "Exploit Opportunities".1 The system generates a conflict_id using an MD5 hash of the first ten characters of the conflicting content and explicitly flags "High Trust mechanism mismatch detected" as a primary attack vector.1 This approach allows the operator to leverage the delay between a vulnerability's discovery by the underground community and its official acknowledgment or remediation by the vendor.
Forensic Analysis of Hardware Spoofing and Fingerprinting Configurations
The local browser profile provided for analysis contains several JSON-formatted configuration files that detail the hardware and software environment the browser is intended to simulate. These files, specifically hardware_profile.json and fingerprint_config.json, reveal a high degree of intentionality in the profile's construction, aimed at evading sophisticated browser fingerprinting systems used by financial institutions and e-commerce platforms.3
Detailed Hardware Profile Analysis
The hardware_profile.json file indicates that the profile is configured to mimic a modern Apple device. Specifically, it simulates a MacBookPro18,1, which corresponds to the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models released in late 2021.3 The use of this specific hardware profile is a common tactic in antidetect browsing, as high-end Apple devices are often associated with users of high financial value and lower fraud probability, thereby increasing the trust score assigned to the session by automated risk engines.

	The presence of a specific Board Serial and a unique UUID suggests that this profile is intended for use in an antidetect browser environment such as AdsPower, GoLogin, or Multilogin.3 These tools allow operators to maintain isolated browser environments, each with its own hardware signature, to prevent websites from linking multiple accounts to a single physical machine.
Fingerprinting Configuration and Deterministic Noise
The fingerprint_config.json file provides further insight into the methods used to bypass detection. A critical feature of this configuration is the use of "deterministic" noise for canvas and audio fingerprinting.4 Modern browser tracking techniques often involve rendering hidden images or audio signals to generate a unique identifier based on the device's hardware and software nuances. Antidetect browsers counter this by adding "noise"—slight variations in the output—to ensure that each profile generates a unique fingerprint.
In this specific profile, the noise is not random but is instead governed by fixed seeds: 1111815028 for the canvas and 1111815029 for the audio.4 The use of deterministic noise is a significant forensic finding, as it allows the profile to maintain a consistent fingerprint over multiple sessions while still appearing unique to the target website. This consistency is essential for avoiding the "fingerprint drift" that can occur if noise is generated randomly, which is often flagged by sophisticated fraud detection systems like Stripe’s Machine ID (__stripe_mid) tracking.2 The noise value is set to a precise 0.0001, a level subtle enough to be imperceptible to typical monitoring tools but sufficient to alter the generated hash.4
Forensic Analysis of Session Metadata and Financial Artifacts
The analysis of the browser profile’s internal state files, specifically sessionstore.js and commerce_tokens.json, provides a timeline of the profile's activity and identifies the specific financial services it has interacted with. These artifacts are essential for understanding the profile's operational history and its relationship with external payment processors.2
Active Session and Tab History
The sessionstore.js file reveals that the profile was active as recently as February 10, 2026, with the last update occurring at 3:12:47 PM.6 The session started on November 6, 2025, indicating that the profile has been in use for approximately three months. Interestingly, the tab history shows only a single window with a "New Tab" page (about:home), suggesting that the profile may have been cleared of its browsing history or that it is being used for automated, headless operations where persistent tabs are not maintained.6

	The lack of crash history is particularly notable for an antidetect profile, as it indicates that the hardware and fingerprinting modifications are well-integrated and do not cause instability in the browser’s execution engine. This stability is a prerequisite for reliable long-term operations, such as account warming or automated financial harvesting.
Extracted Payment Tokens and Service Identifiers
The recovery of commerce_tokens.json provides direct evidence of the profile's interaction with major global payment processors. These tokens are not merely cookies but are session-linked identifiers used by these services to maintain state, verify device trust, and facilitate transactions.2

	The presence of tokens from Stripe, PayPal, Adyen, and Braintree in a single profile is highly significant. These services represent the backbone of global e-commerce payment processing. The __stripe_mid (Machine ID) is specifically designed to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions by tracking the hardware environment of the payer. Similarly, the Adyen device_fp and Braintree device_id are used to build a reputation score for the device over time.2 The fact that all these tokens are co-located in this profile suggests it has been used to conduct transactions across multiple platforms while maintaining a consistent (spoofed) identity.
Procedural Operations and the Bridge Protocol
The operational documentation, particularly the "Oblivion Operations Manual v2.1," outlines a structured approach to conducting offensive research in environments where the primary logic core—the Prometheus-Core—is air-gapped or otherwise restricted from direct internet access.1 This protocol, known as the "Bridge Protocol," utilizes an external AI interface (the Gemini Interface) as a data relay or "bridge" between the open web and the isolated Python environment.
Phase 1: The Intelligence Harvest
The initial phase of the protocol involves the operator using the Gemini Interface to conduct reconnaissance on a specific target. The manual provides an example of researching the latest CVEs for Apache Struts.1 The AI's role in this phase is to aggregate and synthesize information from a wide range of sources, including official patch notes and "underground" discussions on platforms like Reddit.1 The key findings are then extracted and formatted into a structured JSON-like list, ensuring that the data is ready for consumption by the logic core.
The importance of the formatting stage cannot be overstated. By categorizing findings as "DOCS" (official) or "REDDIT" (sentiment), the operator provides the necessary inputs for the Prometheus-Core’s OpinionSplitter and ParaconsistentEngine.1 This manual intervention acts as a filtration layer, ensuring that only relevant, actionable intelligence is passed into the restricted environment.
Phase 2: Injection and Plan Generation
The second phase of the Bridge Protocol involves the manual "injection" of the harvested data into the injected_data list variable within the Prometheus_Unified_Core_v2.1.py script.1 This process bypasses the air-gap by relying on the operator to transfer the text-based data from the internet-connected interface to the isolated machine. Once the data is injected, the script is executed, triggering the generation of a DeepResearchPlan.
The DeepResearchPlan is a structured JSON object that follows a strict schema defined in the "System Prompt".1 This plan includes a unique planID, the objective of the operation, the operational security (opsec) level, and a series of stages for execution.


Research Plan Stage
	Description
	Key Findings / Tasks
	Phase 1: Intel Segregation
	Separating vendor claims from operator reality.
	Counts of hard data vs. sentiment; key intelligence list. 1
	Phase 2: Conflict Exploitation
	Analysis of logic gaps identified between sources.
	Conflict IDs, official stance vs. reality, exploit opportunity. 1
	Phase 3: Operational Vectors
	Actionable tasks for the red team simulation.
	Specific actions like "Bypass controls" or "Execute payload." 1
	The output of this phase is a strategic roadmap that guides the operator through the exploitation process, leveraging the synthesis of conflicting information to identify the most effective attack vectors.
Phase 3: Visualization and the Oblivion Dashboard
The final phase of the protocol, which is listed as optional but highly recommended, involves feeding the generated JSON plan into the "Oblivion Dashboard".1 This dashboard is a React-based environment that provides a graphical representation of the research findings, the identified conflicts, and the proposed attack vectors. The existence of a dedicated dashboard indicates that the Prometheus-Core is part of a larger, integrated platform for offensive security operations, designed to provide operators with a high-level overview of complex, multi-stage missions.
Strategic Context: Antidetect Ecosystems and Security Vulnerabilities
The forensic analysis of the profile and its associated logic must be placed within the broader context of the antidetect browser market and the evolving threat landscape. Tools like AdsPower, GoLogin, and Multilogin are essential for maintaining multiple identities across the web, but they are also subject to their own vulnerabilities and security risks.5
The Antidetect Browser Market and Teamwork Organization
The research materials highlight the differences in how leading antidetect browsers manage profiles and teamwork. GoLogin, for instance, uses a system of "Folders" to facilitate profile sharing and teamwork, and it supports a "web version" that allows access to profiles from different devices.5 AdsPower, by contrast, focuses on multi-level permissions and automated "robot action recorders" for routine tasks and account warming.5 Multilogin is noted for its highly granular customization of browser fingerprints, allowing for the generation of unique identities with a single click.5


Browser Tool
	Key Feature
	Operational Significance
	GoLogin
	Cloud-based profile folders
	Facilitates remote teamwork and multi-device access. 5
	AdsPower
	Robot action recorder
	Automates behavioral patterns to mimic human users. 5
	Multilogin
	Granular fingerprint customization
	Provides the highest level of control over the identity signature. 5
	The choice of tool often depends on the specific requirements of the operation. For instance, the profile analyzed here, with its detailed hardware profile and deterministic noise, is highly characteristic of the level of control offered by these professional-grade tools.
Security Vulnerabilities and the AdsPower Data Breach
While antidetect browsers are designed to provide security and anonymity for their users, they are not immune to attacks. A notable incident mentioned in the research is a data breach involving AdsPower that resulted in the loss of $4.1 million in cryptocurrency funds.5 This breach underscores the risk of centralizing highly sensitive browser profiles and financial tokens in a single platform. If the platform itself is compromised, every profile it manages—including the associated cookies, session tokens, and hardware signatures—is at risk.
This historical context is relevant to the analysis of the current profile. The co-location of Stripe, PayPal, and Adyen tokens in a single commerce_tokens.json file represents a significant "single point of failure" for the operator.2 If this local profile were to be captured, as it has been in this forensic scenario, the entire set of financial identities and their associated trust scores would be compromised.
Deep Research Mode and the Synthesis of Intelligence
The "Deep Research Mode" (Mode B) of the Prometheus-Core represents the most advanced operational state of the system.1 This mode is triggered by specific keywords such as "Research," "Plan," or "Investigate" and follows a rigorous methodology described in the documentation as "Oblivion Harvest Protocol".1
The Role of "Wild" Data
A core directive of the Oblivion Harvest Protocol is to prioritize "wild" data from forums, repositories, and pastebins over "sanitized" marketing materials or official documentation.1 This is based on the premise that marketing pages are designed to project an image of security, whereas underground sources provide a more accurate reflection of a system's actual vulnerabilities.
The protocol instructs the system to "always look for the exception to the rule"—the bypass, the exploit, or the edge case.1 This emphasis on the "exception" is what drives the paraconsistent synthesis. By focusing on the gaps between rules, the Prometheus-Core identifies attack vectors that are often overlooked by traditional security audits.
JSON Schema Rigidity and Operational Tempo
In Deep Research Mode, the Prometheus-Core is required to adhere to a rigid JSON schema for its output.1 This rigidity ensures that the generated plans are machine-readable and can be easily integrated into the "Oblivion Dashboard" or other automated tools. The use of terms like "Vector," "Payload," "Harvest," and "Divergence" in the output reinforces the offensive, red-team frame of the operation.1
The "Operational Tempo" of the system is described as "High-Tempo," with an emphasis on concise, "no-fluff" responses in Assistant Mode and technically profound analysis in Research Mode.1 This allows the operator to maintain a rapid pace of operations, moving from reconnaissance to plan generation and execution with minimal delay.
Implications for Modern Security Operations
The existence of a framework like Prometheus-Core, combined with the forensic evidence of a highly tuned antidetect browser profile, highlights several emerging trends in the cybersecurity landscape. The convergence of AI-driven intelligence synthesis with identity obfuscation technology creates a potent tool for offensive operations that can bypass both behavioral and technical security controls.
The Challenge of Paraconsistent Threats
Most modern security defenses are based on the assumption of logical consistency—a system is either patched or it isn't. However, the Prometheus-Core’s use of paraconsistent logic allows it to operate in the "grey area" between these states. By identifying and exploiting the delay between vulnerability discovery and remediation, the system can launch attacks that are "logically valid" within the underground reality even if they are "officially mitigated" in the vendor documentation.
This poses a significant challenge for security teams, who must now monitor not only their own systems but also the underground sentiment regarding those systems. The ability to detect "Operational Reality Divergence" becomes a critical defensive capability in an era where AI can automate the identification of these gaps.
The Limits of Browser Fingerprinting
The forensic analysis of the fingerprint_config.json and hardware_profile.json files demonstrates that browser fingerprinting is no longer a silver bullet for fraud detection.3 As antidetect tools become more sophisticated, they are able to simulate high-trust environments with increasing accuracy. The use of deterministic noise seeds ensures that these spoofed identities remain consistent over time, making them indistinguishable from legitimate users to all but the most advanced behavioral analysis systems.
For financial services and e-commerce platforms, this means that device-based trust can no longer be the sole factor in risk assessment. Instead, organizations must move toward a more holistic "Identity and Behavior" model that looks at a broader range of signals to determine the legitimacy of a session.
Final Forensic Synthesis
The comprehensive forensic analysis of the browser profile and the Prometheus-Core v2.1 documentation reveals a highly integrated and professionalized offensive system. The profile itself is a masterclass in identity obfuscation, utilizing precise hardware spoofing and deterministic fingerprinting noise to simulate a high-trust Apple device.3 The presence of multiple high-value financial session tokens indicates that the profile has been successfully used to engage with some of the world's most secure payment ecosystems.2
The Prometheus-Core framework provides the cognitive engine for this operation, using a combination of semantic redefinition and paraconsistent logic to transform raw intelligence into actionable attack plans.1 The "Bridge Protocol" demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of network security, providing a reliable method for leveraging AI-driven reconnaissance even in air-gapped or restricted environments.1
The ultimate goal of this system, as expressed in its own documentation, is to move beyond the constraints of "sanitized" security into the "reality" of exploitation.1 The forensic capture of this profile and its associated logic provides a rare window into the tactics, techniques, and procedures of an advanced offensive operator, serving as a stark reminder of the evolving nature of the modern threat landscape.
