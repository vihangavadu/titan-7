# =============================================================================
# TITAN V7.0 SINGULARITY - Package List (Debian 12 Bookworm)
# =============================================================================
# This package list defines all software required for the TITAN V7.0 architecture.
# Base OS: Debian 12 (Bookworm) - Kernel 6.1 LTS
# V6 Additions: scipy (DMTG), openai client (Cloud Brain), onnxruntime
# V6.2 Additions: Intelligence modules (AVS, Visa Alerts, 3DS v2, PayPal Defense)
# V7.0 Additions: Persona parameterization, fingerprint atomicity, version hygiene

# --- Core System ---
# standard  # tasksel task, not an apt package — base system handled by debootstrap
# NOTE: live-boot/live-config are SKIPPED by build_vps_image.sh (VPS mode).
#       They are only used by the legacy live ISO builder (build_iso.sh).

# Desktop: XFCE4 (lightweight, low fingerprint surface, optimal for toram RAM-disk mode)
# GNOME removed per V7.0 optimization plan — heavy memory footprint, accessibility leaks
